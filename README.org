* DS Lib

This is my personal library for Data Structures implemented in C. Initially, I'm building it to use it on the [[https://ufmg.br/cursos/graduacao/2377/91205/72554][Data Structures course at UFMG]]. To facilitate this use case, this is a header-only library and performance is desired but not mandatory.

** Contents

Implementations included:

- [[file:include/ds_lib/list.h][Doubly Linked List]]
